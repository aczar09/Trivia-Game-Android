| Rank   | Requirements                          | Comments                                                                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High   | Single Player Game Mode               | Vital, as it the most basic mode and whole point of the app                        |
| High   | Giving a question                     | Vital, as questions make up trivia                                                 |
| High   | Answering a question                  | Vital, as answers have to be correct or incorrect                                  | 
| Medium | Choosing a category                   | It is not as important as not every game requires players to choose their category |
 | Medium | Breakout for Incorrect Response       | Can implement this in different ways, for instance a fixed amount of questions     |
 | Medium | Player answers 10 questions correctly | Same reason as incorrect response breakout                                         |
 | Low    | Multiplayer Game Mode                 | Not as important, as ot os riskier to implement                                    |
| Low    | Choosing a Random Game Mode           | Not important, but a cool add-on                                                   |
| Low    | Post Results                          | Not required to function, but nice added feature                                   |
