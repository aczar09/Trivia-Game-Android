## Trivia Game: Functionality

This Android app serves as a provides a multiple choice trivia game experience, which in the future will
include various game show formats. The user can select to play as many rounds of
5 question multiple choice trivia as they'd like, with each rounding ending once the user
has either got all 5 right or answered one incorrectly. However, there are some limitations:
1. There is only one game mode available to play, single-player multiple choice, but this will
expand in the future.
2. Each round, the game pulls from the same question pool, so repeat questions are inevitable across
rounds, but not within rounds themselves
3. No data persistence as of right now, every time the game starts, previous results aren't kept track of.



## How to Run
In order to run this app, you must open Android Studio and set a configuration with Trivia_Game.app.main, 
and press the green play button at the top left. The app should be run on Pixel 5 API 30 emulator,
